### Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Java (Spring Boot)
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Database**: MySQL (or any relational database)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **API Communication**: RESTful API using Axios for HTTP requests
- **State Management**: Redux (for frontend state management)

- **Database integration** with Spring Data JPA for interacting with MySQL (or any relational database).
- **Error handling**, **validation**, and **logging** for smooth operations.
- **API Documentation** using Postman UI for testing and simulating requests.

### Core Backend Features:
- **User Registration**: Users can register an account by providing details like name, email, and password.
- **Login**: Use JWT to log in and generate a token for each session, enabling secure operations.
- **Password Reset**: Provide a password recovery feature via email.
- **Product Management**: Manage product listings, allowing CRUD operations (add, update, delete products).
